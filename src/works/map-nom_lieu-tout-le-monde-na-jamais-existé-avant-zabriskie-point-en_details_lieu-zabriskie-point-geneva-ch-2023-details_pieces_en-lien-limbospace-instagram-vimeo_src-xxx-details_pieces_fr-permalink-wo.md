  PART 1

  This comfort here;

  This jacuzzi

  This knowingness that your rotten ethics rule the world

  This suit and tie

  This overflowing of your assets

  This toy car

  This game

  This crackle

  This buzz

  This being nothing and everything at the same time

  This ungrammatical certainty

  This trickle down effect, rippling in your pants

  This titular experience

  This jacuzzi again

  This flow

  This non-grief

  This non-anger

  This business

  This neurotic bypassing of all things discomforting

  This purchase power

  This whirlpool,

  Is comforting to you?


  PART 2

  Victor’s work starts from the absurdity of absolutism and in this path, his works

  take the form of various systems and setups of absolute absurdity. The space

  echoes the remnant of a blitz and glitz that now read as unmerited and frivolous.

  A portrait of an era that is seen in this state just feels cringe. The structures

  built in the space are barely holding up, the electronics are bugging, small fires

  commencing, bits of big and little men are littering the space. Victor’s intentions

  here spell out a need to get through the impasse of crisis and depression brought

  upon capitalistic neurosis, by means of turning this existence into something

  temporary. This all didn’t exist before it existed, so it’s only logical these systems

  won’t have their place in the future.


  PART 3

  Someone who I know is a philosopher of sorts, the kind that is in the highest

  echelons of its academic study. When I asked him whether the title of the show

  is doing something similar to philosophy in its aspiration to be an incontestable

  truth, he said yes but specifically those that aren’t trivial or tautologous.

  Thus rather crudely implying the title statement was not one of those of more

  noble pursuits, just because he had to frantically defend the honour of his discipline.

  Not to shit on philosophy but is it not obvious that the trivial and tautologous

  is exactly what that kind of absolutism gets us at?


  PART 4

  Who is everyone to you because it’s not the same for everyone (whoops).
