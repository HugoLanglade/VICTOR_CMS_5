  Victor Delétraz ( *1997 ) is an artist living and working in Geneva. He
  recently 

  graduated from the HEAD-Geneva with a Master’s degree in visual arts.


  His practice revolves around sculpture, writing, music, video, painting and performance. Imagining each project as a unique situation to be dealt with in the moment, his work questions the world around him, transforming everyday objects and their meanings to create other narratives and writing, both absurd and engaged. 

  He is currently interested in woobly structures to interact with (and get inside), silly & powerful poems, slides & tricks in white cube and clowny rusty dances.


  His installations often include moving objects, objects with performative potentials, that can be activated or desactivated, sculptures that colapse by themselves or ready made / found pieces in conversation with well-made pieces.


  His installations are stages for his performances. With simple actions that may seem unmastered, he composes with improvisation and defined, rehearsed gestures. He creates frameworks that allow surprises to happen and thus instantaneous and honest moments that go beyond him like a tropism.


  He often uses a common vocabulary to each performance : smoke, fire, spectacular or failed special effects, text, music or interaction with the audience.

  He explores notions of failure and vulnerability, with humour and absurdity. 


  Victor Delétraz has exhibited and performed in Athens, Sofia, Marseille, Geneva at Soul2Soul, Topic, Espace 3353, at he BIG 21 & 23 and had his first solo show at Zabriskie Point curated by Limbo Space in November 2023.
