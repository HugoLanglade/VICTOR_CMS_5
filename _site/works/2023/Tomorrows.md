description_fr: >-
  Presence is the best we can offer. In a familiar space, yet not quite like it.
  We feel at home when the exhibition takes place in a former flat. 

  We connect with you and our work.

  A friend once shared with me that an artist they knew spent a majority of their time applying for residencies and sending portfolios, leaving little room for creating art. We hope to maintain a balance between our passion and our relationships, and view making art as a way of caring for our colleagues.

  We are creating a temporary group for ephemeral exhibitions.

  In today’s fast-paced world, we are constantly searching for new ways to stand out and grab attention. We pay attention to detail and strive for minimalism.


  The ability to consume information quickly has become a norm, but we should approach creating art with the same mindset. Instead of filming long videos, we

  should aim to create thousands of one-minute videos. 

  We all become content creators.

  We want something to happen. The desire to create collectively may stem from

  the rush of dopamine we experience through social connections.

  Soon, every apartment will become an off-space and people will be living in

  museums.
